# Snake-For-AI
The classical game *Snake* written in Python with prerequisites to be used by AI.


# About
This game was written with the purpose of being used in AI applications. The code includes calculations of relevant distances as vectors to aid the algorithm. Distances calculated:

* Snake head to its body
* Snake head to food
* Snake head to borders

The Turtle library is used for graphics and objects.


# Use
**Controls:** The arrow buttons _Left, Down, Right_ and _Up_ were selected as controls. The _q_-button ends the game.

**Speed:** The variable `delay` adjusts the frequency at which the screen updates, thus adjusting the speed of the head. `delay` is set to `0.1` but may be adjusted.


# Prerequisites

* Python 3.6
